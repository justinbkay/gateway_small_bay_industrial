# Gateway Small Bay Industrial

**8934 E. Waltham Ave. Mesa, AZ 85212**\
**1,040 â€“ 2,437 SF | 20 Units**

This exciting new project is expected to begin construction soon with spaces coming available late 2024. There are very few small bay industrial spaces available in this part of the east valley. Most of the other spaces are larger, which due to the higher cost for rent, puts the possibility of renting a space for your business to grow out-of-reach for many small businesses. The purpose of this website is to advertise the project and to begin a waiting list. If interested, please submit an email with your contact information to [admin@olympusCM.com](mailto:admin@olympusCM.com) and you'll recieve a response from us with more information about the project.
